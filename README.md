## Description

GitHub Link: https://github.com/smithz852/social-network-api.git

Video Tutorial Link:

An API for setting up routes similar to ones used in social network apps so that users can create profiles, comment on posts, and add friends.

## Installations

MongoDB, MongoDB Compass, Node.js, Express.js, VS Code, Insomnia

## Usage

Once cloned, users can start the API via "node index.js" from the main section of the repo in VS Code. Insomnia can be opened afterwards, and routes can be created in accordance with the ones available in the "routes" folder within the repo. You can then test the routes by posting the data that aligns with the DB models in the repo. More instructions can be found in the tutorial video.
